The challenge is to program a simple version of the game Battleships. 
Create an application to allow a single human player to play a one-sided game of Battleships against ships placed by the computer.
The program should create a 10x10 grid, and place a number of ships on the grid at random with the following sizes:
• 1x Battleship (5 squares)
• 2x Destroyers (4 squares)
The player enters coordinates of the form “A5”, where "A" is the column and "5" is the row, to specify a square to target. Optionally, you can use also the mouse click on the cell.
Shots result in hits, misses or sinks. 
The game ends when all ships are sunk.
